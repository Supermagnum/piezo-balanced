# piezo-balanced
A small board that uses a LSK389B, for premablifying and impedance matching of two piezo electric crystals. It has balanced input and output.
I hope it does not have any bloopers, I think it should work on +48 phantom power.
It anyone spots something wrong, please correct or notify me.
