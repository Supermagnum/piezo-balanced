# piezo-balanced
A small board that uses a LSK389B, for preamplifier and impedance matching of two piezo electric crystals. It has balanced input and output.
I hope it does not have any bloopers as I have difficulty with maths, 
I think it should work on +48 phantom power.

It anyone spots something wrong, please fork and correct or notify me.
